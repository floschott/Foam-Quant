foamquant: a 4D foam quantification toolbox
###############################################

FoamQuant is a toolbox specifically developed for processing time series of large 3D images of evolving foams.  The implementation of our algorithms is based on open source libraries: scikit-image [1] and SPAM [2].  The toolbox is organized in modules each built around one specific task.
