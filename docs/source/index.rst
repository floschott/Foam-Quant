Welcome to foamquant documentation
===================================

.. important::
   This project is under construction. New functionalities are constantly added to this package.

**foamquant** is a toolbox specifically created for processing time series of 3D images of evolving liquid foams by using open source libraries Scikit-Image [vanderWalt2014]_ and SPAM [Stamani2020]_. 

The **objective** is a greater accessibility of time-resolved liquid foam 3D analysis tools for the foam-physicis and food scientists communitites. We propose the following documentation: **API** and **Jupyter Notebooks**.

Main dependencies: 'SPAM <https://ttk.gricad-pages.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/spam/>'_ **SPAM** and **scikit-image**
