Welcome to foamquant's documentation! (project in progress)
===================================

**foamquant** is a toolbox specifically created for processing time series of 3D images of evolving liquid foams by using open source libraries Scikit-Image [vanderWalt2014]_ and SPAM [Stamani2020]_. 

The **objective** is a greater accessibility of time-resolved liquid foam 3D analysis tools for the foam-physicis and food scientists communitites.

We propose a readthedocs documentation with three sections: **API reference**, **Jupyter Notebooks examples** and  **Tutorials**
