Welcome to foamquant's documentation!
===================================

**foamquant** (/lu'make/) FoamQuant is a toolbox specifically developed for processing time series of large 3D images of evolving foams. The implementation of our algorithms is based on open source libraries: scikit-image [1] and SPAM [2]. The toolbox is organized in modules each built around one specific task:

1) process
2) quantif
3) figure
